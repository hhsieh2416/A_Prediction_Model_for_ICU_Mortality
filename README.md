# Prediction_Model_for_ICU_Mortality
By referencing two ICU outcome retrospective studies, I identified 9 variables from 758 thousands of chat events and 76 thousands of lab events and built a RamdomForest Model to predict who survives during the ICU stay with a 21.6% OOB error rate. As a beginner in Machine Learning, I am happy with the algorithm and look forward to doing more.

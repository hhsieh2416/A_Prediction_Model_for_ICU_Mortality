# [Prediction_Model_for_ICU_Mortality](https://rpubs.com/hhsieh2416/716884)
The objective is to build a prediction model for identifying patients who are likely to die during their ICU stay, and I also focus on doing some illustrative data visualization for various predictors along the way.

By referencing two ICU outcome retrospective studies, I identified 9 variables from 758,000s of chart events and 76,000s of lab events and built a Random Forest Model to predict who survives during the ICU stay with a 21.6% OOB error rate. As a beginner in Machine Learning, I am happy with the algorithm and look forward to doing more.
